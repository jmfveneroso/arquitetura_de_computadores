abstract = "Abstract The ZigBee network is widely studied and deployed recently because of its low cost and simplicity features. However, the power consumption issue needs a further improvement since the application requirements are not fully satisfied. The emerging 5G communication technology is characterized by the smarter devices and the native support for the \{M2M\} communication. On that basis, the 5G terminals are capable of joining the existing ZigBee networks and have the potential to improve the data transmission. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the ZigBee networks in the 5G environment for different scenarios. Then a nearest access routing (NAR) algorithm based on the physical depth is proposed for different communication types. To reduce the loads in ZigBee networks, the data flow in the neighborhood of 5G terminals is gathered and transmitted via the \{IP\} networks. The simulation results showed that \{NAR\} effectively share the communication in ZigBee networks. It leads to better performances with higher packet delivery ratio, less hop counts from ZigBee devices, lower latency, fewer packets sent by ZigBee nodes and zero routing overheads. "

  Abstract                 = {An ad-hoc network is the cooperative engagement of a collection of mobile nodes without the required intervention of any centralized access point or existing infrastructure. We present Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), a novel algorithm for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. Each mobile host operates as a specialized router, and routes are obtained as needed (i.e., on-demand) with little or no reliance on periodic advertisements. Our new routing algorithm is quite suitable for a dynamic self starting network, as required by users wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks. AODV provides loop-free routes even while repairing broken links. Because the protocol does not require global periodic routing advertisements, the demand on the overall bandwidth available to the mobile nodes is substantially less than in those protocols that do necessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless we can still maintain most of the advantages of basic distance vector routing mechanisms. We show that our algorithm scales to large populations of mobile nodes wishing to form ad-hoc networks. We also include an evaluation methodology and simulation results to verify the operation of our algorithm},

  Abstract                 = {Nodes in mobile ad hoc networks communicate with one another via packet radios on wireless multihop links. Because of node mobility and power limitations, the network topology changes frequently. Routing protocols therefore play an important role in mobile multihop network communications. A trend in ad hoc network routing is the reactive on-demand philosophy where routes are established only when required. Most of the protocols in this category, however, use a single route and do not utilize multiple alternate paths. We propose a scheme to improve existing on-demand routing protocols by creating a mesh and providing multiple alternate routes. Our algorithm establishes the mesh and multipaths without transmitting any extra control message. We apply our scheme to the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol and evaluate the performance improvements by simulation},

  Abstract                 = {A mobile ad hoc network consists of wireless hosts that may move often. Movement of hosts results in a change in routes, requiring some mechanism for determining new routes. Several routing protocols have already been proposed for ad hoc networks. This paper suggests an approach to utilize location information (for instance, obtained using the global positioning system) to improve performance of routing protocols for ad hoc networks. By using location information, the proposed Location-Aided Routing (LAR) protocols limit the search for a new route to a smaller request zone  of the ad hoc network. This results in a significant reduction in the number of routing messages. We present two algorithms to determine the request zone, and also suggest potential optimizations to our algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {The widely-used protocol in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) achieves a dynamic, self-organizing and on-demand multi-hop routing by means of the AODV routing protocol. In AODV, wireless links disconnect occasionally because the nodes on the routing path are unreachable, which makes AODV inefficient and unreliable. By constructing a mesh structure, AODV-BR improves AODV routing protocols and provides multiple alternate routes. The algorithm establishes the mesh and multi-path with the RREP of AODV, which does not transmit many control messages. In this paper, a new improved protocol AODV-BRL is proposed to increase the adaptation of routing protocols to topology changes by modifying AODV-BR. In AODV-BRL the alternate routes are created by the Extended Hello Message as well as RREP packets. Then the Extended Routing Table and the least hop count first (LHF) are proposed to determine the optimal alternative route that significantly reduces the distance between the repair node and the destination. Finally, the performance improvement is evaluated by simulations. According to simulation results it is evident that compared with AODV-BR and AODV, AODV-BRL has a higher packet delivery ratio and lower routing overhead.},
